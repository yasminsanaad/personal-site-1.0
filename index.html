                            <p>Hello, and thank you for visiting. I know that it may be the prettiest website but as I'm going about my journey I hope to hone my skills from all that I've learned and be a better version of myself everytime!</p>

                            <p>After graduating with my Bachelors degree back in 2022, I spent some time trying to find work in my field of study. To my behest, all that time searching led to no results. After talking on the phone with my mother, a college prfessor and long-time educator, I was convinced to look for jobs in education. As my bills crept closer, in desparation, I applied to be a substitute teacher; miraculously, I got the position in almost no time and ended up covering for teachers of children ranging from kindergarten to high-school age. A year later, I become a 2nd grade teacher for Prince William County, and a year after that became a preschool teacher for a daycare program based in Falls Church. Though the years spent in this field were eventful and I carry many wonderful memories from my time in the classroom, I believe that I am being pulled towards a different direction that will challenge me further and elevate me to new opportunites</p>

                            <p>As my major implies, <u>I'm very hands-on and love to create new things.</u> This will be a great change of pace for me because learning about how to code and how to utilize different languages will allow me to establish my own projects based on my own personal interests. I also think that utilizing past experience in the classroom will open doors to help teachers and students be successful at any age or grade! I'm looking forward to what this journey will bring and I can't want to bring you along with me!</p>
